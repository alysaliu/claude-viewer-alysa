[00:00:04] Roberto Martinez: Roberto Martinez.

[00:00:08] Attorney Johnson: And what is your occupation?

[00:00:11] Roberto Martinez: I own Martinez Construction LLC.

[00:00:17] Attorney Johnson: How long have you been in the construction business?

[00:00:21] Roberto Martinez: About eight years now. Started small and built it up.

[00:00:28] Attorney Johnson: On March 15th, 2024, at approximately 2:50 PM, were you driving a vehicle?

[00:00:34] Roberto Martinez: Yes, I was driving my pickup truck.

[00:00:38] Attorney Johnson: Was this a personal vehicle or company vehicle?

[00:00:42] Roberto Martinez: Personal. My white Ford F-150.

[00:00:48] Attorney Johnson: Can you describe the weather conditions that day?

[00:00:53] Roberto Martinez: It was... well, it was clear. Clear and sunny, perfect visibility.

[00:01:00] Attorney Johnson: No rain at all that day?

[00:01:03] Roberto Martinez: No, definitely not. Beautiful day, actually.

[00:01:09] Attorney Johnson: What was your destination that afternoon?

[00:01:13] Roberto Martinez: I was heading home from a job site on Elm Street.

[00:01:19] Attorney Johnson: What type of work were you doing at that site?

[00:01:23] Roberto Martinez: Kitchen renovation. We were wrapping up for the day.

[00:01:29] Attorney Johnson: What time did you leave the job site?

[00:01:33] Roberto Martinez: Around 2:45, maybe 2:46. The accident happened right after.

[00:01:40] Attorney Johnson: Were you tired or fatigued at the time?

[00:01:44] Roberto Martinez: No, I felt fine. Normal day for me.

[00:01:50] Attorney Johnson: Had you consumed any alcohol that day?

[00:01:54] Roberto Martinez: Absolutely not. I was working.

[00:02:00] Attorney Johnson: Any medications that might affect your driving?

[00:02:04] Roberto Martinez: No medications. I don't take anything like that.

[00:02:11] Attorney Johnson: How fast were you traveling when you approached the intersection of Main and Oak?

[00:02:18] Roberto Martinez: I don't remember exactly, but I wasn't speeding. I was going the speed limit.

[00:02:25] Attorney Johnson: And what is the speed limit on that stretch of Main Street?

[00:02:29] Roberto Martinez: Twenty-five miles per hour.

[00:02:33] Attorney Johnson: So you were traveling at 25 mph?

[00:02:37] Roberto Martinez: Yes, that's right. The speed limit.

[00:02:42] Attorney Johnson: Are you familiar with that intersection?

[00:02:46] Roberto Martinez: Very familiar. I drive through there almost daily.

[00:02:52] Attorney Johnson: What color was the traffic light when you first saw it?

[00:02:57] Roberto Martinez: It was green when I first approached.

[00:03:02] Attorney Johnson: Did it change before you reached the intersection?

[00:03:06] Roberto Martinez: Yes, it turned yellow when I was close.

[00:03:12] Attorney Johnson: How close were you when it turned yellow?

[00:03:16] Roberto Martinez: Pretty close. Maybe thirty or forty feet.

[00:03:22] Attorney Johnson: Did you consider stopping?

[00:03:26] Roberto Martinez: For a moment, but I was already committed to going through.

[00:03:33] Attorney Johnson: What color was the light when you entered the intersection?

[00:03:38] Roberto Martinez: Still yellow. I thought I could make it through safely.

[00:03:45] Attorney Johnson: When did you first see the plaintiff's vehicle?

[00:03:50] Roberto Martinez: Right as I was entering. It came from my right side.

[00:03:57] Attorney Johnson: Did you have time to react?

[00:04:01] Roberto Martinez: I tried to brake, but it happened so fast.

[00:04:07] Attorney Johnson: Were you using your cell phone at any point before the accident?

[00:04:14] Roberto Martinez: No, I never use my phone while driving. That's dangerous.

[00:04:21] Attorney Johnson: Not even to check the time or GPS?

[00:04:25] Roberto Martinez: No, I know the area well. Didn't need GPS that day.

[00:04:32] Attorney Johnson: Let me ask you again about your speed. Earlier you said you were going 25 mph?

[00:04:38] Roberto Martinez: Yes, the speed limit.

[00:04:42] Attorney Johnson: But didn't you tell the police officer at the scene that you might have been going 35, maybe 40?

[00:04:50] Roberto Martinez: I... I don't recall saying that exactly.

[00:04:55] Attorney Johnson: You don't recall? Let me refresh your memory.

[00:05:00] Roberto Martinez: I was shaken up after the accident. I might not have been thinking clearly.

[00:05:07] Attorney Johnson: So which is it - 25 mph or 35 to 40 mph?

[00:05:13] Roberto Martinez: I believe I was going the speed limit.

[00:05:18] Attorney Johnson: Let's talk more about the weather. You said it was clear and sunny?

[00:05:24] Roberto Martinez: Yes, perfect visibility.

[00:05:28] Attorney Johnson: Are you aware that the meteorological data for that day shows light rain at the time of the accident?

[00:05:36] Roberto Martinez: I... that doesn't sound right. It was clear when I left the job site.

[00:05:43] Attorney Johnson: And the police report notes "wet road conditions"?

[00:05:48] Roberto Martinez: I don't remember the roads being wet.

[00:05:53] Attorney Johnson: You mentioned you never use your phone while driving?

[00:05:58] Roberto Martinez: That's correct. It's dangerous.

[00:06:02] Attorney Johnson: Do you recognize this document?

[00:06:06] Roberto Martinez: It looks like phone records.

[00:06:10] Attorney Johnson: These are your phone records from March 15th. Do you see the entry at 2:47 PM?

[00:06:18] Roberto Martinez: I see it.

[00:06:21] Attorney Johnson: That shows a 3-minute phone call ending at 2:50 PM. The accident occurred at 2:50:30 PM. Can you explain this?

[00:06:32] Roberto Martinez: I... I might have gotten a call, but I wasn't actively talking while driving.

[00:06:39] Attorney Johnson: But the records show the call lasted 3 minutes and ended 30 seconds before the 911 call. Were you or weren't you on the phone?

[00:06:50] Roberto Martinez: Okay yes, I was talking to my wife about dinner plans. I was focused on the call, not the road.

[00:06:58] Attorney Johnson: So you admit you were distracted by the phone call?

[00:07:04] Roberto Martinez: I guess... yes, I was distracted.

[00:07:09] Attorney Johnson: Going back to the traffic light - you said it was yellow when you entered the intersection?

[00:07:16] Roberto Martinez: Yes.

[00:07:18] Attorney Johnson: Not red?

[00:07:20] Roberto Martinez: No, it was yellow. I'm sure of that.

[00:07:25] Attorney Johnson: But what if I told you that witness statements indicate the light was red?

[00:07:32] Roberto Martinez: I... well, I saw it was yellow but I thought I could make it through before anyone came.

[00:07:40] Attorney Johnson: So you admit you saw the light was red?

[00:07:44] Roberto Martinez: Yes, I saw it was red but I thought I could make it through before anyone came.

[00:07:52] Attorney Johnson: Where exactly did the collision occur?

[00:07:56] Roberto Martinez: Right in the middle of the intersection, I'd say.

[00:08:01] Attorney Johnson: Were you able to brake normally before the collision?

[00:08:06] Roberto Martinez: No, the brakes felt spongy and didn't respond properly when I tried to stop.

[00:08:14] Attorney Johnson: So you're claiming mechanical failure?

[00:08:18] Roberto Martinez: Well, something wasn't right with the brakes.

[00:08:23] Attorney Johnson: But earlier you said you felt fine and everything was normal that day?

[00:08:29] Roberto Martinez: Yes, but the brakes... they felt different when I needed to stop quickly.

[00:08:36] Attorney Johnson: Did you have the vehicle inspected recently?

[00:08:41] Roberto Martinez: No, everything was working fine before that day.

[00:08:46] Attorney Johnson: Why did you enter the intersection on a red light?

[00:08:51] Roberto Martinez: A kid came out of nowhere. I had to choose between hitting the child or running the light.

[00:08:59] Attorney Johnson: There was a child in the intersection?

[00:09:03] Roberto Martinez: Yes, I had to swerve to avoid hitting them.

[00:09:08] Attorney Johnson: But no witness statements mention a child.

[00:09:12] Roberto Martinez: It happened so fast. Maybe they didn't see.

[00:09:17] Attorney Johnson: Mr. Martinez, have you given consistent testimony today?

[00:09:22] Roberto Martinez: I've told you what I remember.

[00:09:26] Attorney Johnson: Let me summarize what you've told us: First, you said 25 mph, then admitted to possibly 35-40 mph. You said clear weather, but records show rain. You denied phone use, then admitted to a 3-minute call. You said yellow light, then admitted it was red. You claim brake failure and a child in the road. Which version is true?

[00:09:48] Roberto Martinez: I was trying to remember accurately. It was a traumatic event.`;

     1                   weren't you on the phone?
     2   MR. MARTINEZ:   Okay yes, I was talking to my wife about dinner
     3                   plans. I was focused on the call, not the road.
     4   MS. JOHNSON:    So you admit you were distracted by the phone call?
     5   MR. MARTINEZ:   I guess... yes, I was distracted.
     6   MS. JOHNSON:    Going back to the traffic light - you said it was
     7                   yellow when you entered the intersection?
     8   MR. MARTINEZ:   Yes.
     9   MS. JOHNSON:    Not red?
    10   MR. MARTINEZ:   No, it was yellow. I'm sure of that.
    11   MS. JOHNSON:    But what if I told you that witness statements
    12                   indicate the light was red?
    13   MR. MARTINEZ:   I... well, I saw it was yellow but I thought I
    14                   could make it through before anyone came.
    15   MS. JOHNSON:    So you admit you saw the light was red?

    17                   it through before anyone came.

    24   MS. JOHNSON:    So you're claiming mechanical failure?
    25   MR. MARTINEZ:   Well, something wasn't right with the brakes.

     1   MS. JOHNSON:    But earlier you said you felt fine and everything
     2                   was normal that day?
     3   MR. MARTINEZ:   Yes, but the brakes... they felt different when I
     4                   needed to stop quickly.
     5   MS. JOHNSON:    Did you have the vehicle inspected recently?
     6   MR. MARTINEZ:   No, everything was working fine before that day.
     7   MS. JOHNSON:    Why did you enter the intersection on a red light?
     8   MR. MARTINEZ:   A kid came out of nowhere. I had to choose between
     9                   hitting the child or running the light.
    10   MS. JOHNSON:    There was a child in the intersection?
    11   MR. MARTINEZ:   Yes, I had to swerve to avoid hitting them.
    12   MS. JOHNSON:    But no witness statements mention a child.
    13   MR. MARTINEZ:   It happened so fast. Maybe they didn't see.
    14   MS. JOHNSON:    Mr. Martinez, have you given consistent testimony
    15                   today?
    16   MR. MARTINEZ:   I've told you what I remember.
    17   MS. JOHNSON:    Let me summarize what you've told us: First, you
    18                   said 25 mph, then admitted to possibly 35-40 mph.
    19                   You said clear weather, but records show rain. You
    20                   denied phone use, then admitted to a 3-minute call.
